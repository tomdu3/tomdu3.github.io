## Project 1: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

**Main Goals**:

- Implement the classic game where a player competes against the computer.
- Provide the ability for the user to make a choice and for the computer to randomly select an option.
- Determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

**Guidelines**:

- Create a function for the player's choice and another for the computer's choice using randomization.
- Define the rules that determine the winner (rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock).
- Use a loop to allow the game to be played multiple times until the user decides to quit.
- Implement input validation to ensure the user inputs valid choices (rock, paper, or scissors).
- Display the results of each round and keep track of the score (wins for player, wins for computer, and draws).

## Project 2: Simple Alarm Clock

**Main Goals**:

- Create a basic alarm clock that allows users to set an alarm time.
- Notify users when the alarm goes off.
- Provide options to set, check, and stop the alarm.

**Guidelines**:

- Use the datetime module to manage the current time and set the alarm time.
- Implement a function to check the current time against the set alarm time.
- Use a loop to keep the program running, allowing users to adjust or check the alarm.
- Allow the user to input the alarm time in a specific format (e.g., HH:MM).
- Provide notifications (e.g., console message or sound) when the alarm time is reached.
- Include the ability for the user to turn off the alarm once it has been triggered.

## Project 3: Hangman Game
- Description: Create a simple Hangman game where the user has to guess the word in 6 tries or less.

Here's a screen cast (terminal) of the project that I have made. Now, you don't have to do it the same way, especially with graphics. I also added the key to the solution for the testing purposes. It appears immeadiately at the beginning of the execution.:
