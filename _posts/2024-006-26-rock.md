## Objective:
Create a simple game of Rock, Paper, Scissors that you can play against the computer in your console (the terminal).

## Problem Description:
- **Player's Choice:** The player will choose one of three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- **Computer's Choice:** The computer will randomly pick one of the three options.
- **Determine the Winner:** The game follows these rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- **Display Results:** Show the outcome of each round (e.g., Computer wins, Player wins, Tie).
- **Multiple Rounds:** Let the player play as many rounds as they want until they choose to stop.

## Steps to Build the Game:

1. ***Understand the Game Logic:***
- **Rules:** Define the rules that determine who wins each round.
- **Player Input:** Use the `input()` function to ask the player for their choice.
- **Handle Invalid Inputs:** Make sure the player can only choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

2. ***Generate Computer’s Choice:***
- **Random Choice:** Use Python's `random` module to let the computer pick Rock, Paper, or Scissors randomly.

3. ***Compare Choices and Determine the Winner:***
- **Create a Function:** Write a function that takes the player’s choice and the computer’s choice, compares them, and decides who wins.

4. ***Allow Multiple Rounds:***
- **Use a Loop:** Use a loop (like `while True:`) to let the player keep playing until they choose to stop.
- **Ask to Continue:** At the end of each round, ask if they want to play again. If they say no, end the game.

5. ***Display Results:***
- **Show Choices and Results:** After each round, print the player’s choice, the computer’s choice, and who won.

6. ***End the Game:***
- **Exit Option:** Give the player a way to quit the game by typing something like "quit" or "exit".

7. ***Keep Score:*** (Optional) 
- **Track Scores:** You can keep track of how many rounds the player wins, loses, or ties, and display the scores at the end of the game.
