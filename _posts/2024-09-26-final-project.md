For your final project, you have some exciting options to choose from! Here’s a simple breakdown of the two main projects you can work on:

## 1. Car Loan Calculator

This project involves creating a calculator that helps users understand the costs associated with purchasing a car through a loan. You’ll ask the user for important information about their car choices, including:

- Vehicle details: Make, model, and fuel efficiency.
- Driving habits: How much they typically drive on weekdays and weekends.
- Expected costs: Maintenance and repair costs, as well as the car's purchase price.
- Loan details: Interest rates and any down payment options.

You will compute monthly costs, which include the loan payment and fuel expenses, and then provide a recommendation on which car would be the better option based on costs.

## 2. Quiz Game

In this project, you will create an interactive quiz game that tests players' knowledge. The game will include:

- 15 questions divided into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and hard. You’ll generate these questions randomly.
- A scoring system to keep track of points and display scores at the end of the game.
- A high score feature to store and show the best scores on a leaderboard.
- An easy-to-navigate menu that lets players start the game, view instructions, or see high scores.

You can make this project more interesting by using external questions from an API or by scraping a trivia website!

## Personal Project (Optional)

If neither of these projects spark your interest, there’s also the option to propose your own project. It should be similar in complexity to the ones mentioned above and must be approved by your tutor.
