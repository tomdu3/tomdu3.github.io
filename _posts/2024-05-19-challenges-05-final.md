You are required to complete one of the two following assignments. If you could do both, even better, but I don't want to overload you with too many projects

## Project 1: Student Grades Management System

### Objective
Develop a system to manage and analyze student grades using complex data structures.

### Requirements
- Store student information (name, ID) and their grades using dictionaries.
- Use tuples to store grade details (subject, score).
- Utilize sets to track unique subjects.

### Features
- Add new students and their grades.
- Update existing grades.
- Calculate the average grade for each student.
- List all students and their grades.

### Guidance
- **Data Structure:** Use a nested dictionary to store student information and grades.
- **Calculations:** Write functions to calculate averages and handle grade updates.
- **Validation:** Ensure grades are valid numbers and handle invalid input gracefully.
- **User Interface:** Create a command-line interface for user interactions.

### Extras
- **Exporting:** Export student information and grades to CSV files (optional). Look up for the `csv` module in Python.

## Project 2: Contact Book Application

### Objective
Develop a contact book application to store and manage contact information using dictionaries and tuples.

### Requirements
- Store contact details (name, phone number, email) using dictionaries.
- Use tuples to store immutable contact information (date of birth, address).
- Implement search and update functionalities.

### Features
- Add new contacts.
- Update existing contacts.
- Search for contacts by name.
- List all contacts.

### Guidance
- **Data Structure:** Use dictionaries for mutable data and tuples for immutable data.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement search by name with partial matches.
- **Error Handling:** Manage errors gracefully, such as updating a non-existent contact.
- **User Experience:** Design an intuitive user interface for adding, updating, and searching contacts.

### Extras
- **Exporting:** Export contact information to CSV files (optional). Look up for the `csv` module in Python.
