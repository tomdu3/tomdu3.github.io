## 7.1. Virtual Environment

![Virtual Environment](../assets/img/virtualai.jpeg)

- Virtual environments are a way to isolate Python code from each other. It allows you to run Python code in different environments, and use the same Python code in multiple environments.
- It gives you a separate Python environment for each project. It allows you to use different versions of Python for different projects.
- It is also useful for testing different versions of Python.
- Virtual environments are also a good way for using environmental variables that contain passwords or other sensitive information.

### 7.1.1 Virtual Environment Generated by Python

- [Python Docs: *Creation of virtual environment*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

#### 7.1.1.1 Create a virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

#### 7.1.1.2. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 7.1.1.3. Deactivate the virtual environment

```bash
deactivate
```

#### 7.1.1.4. Remove the virtual environment
- To remove the virtual environment, you can use the `rm` command. You are practically deleting the virtual environment folder.

```bash
rm -rf venv
```

### 7.1.2. Virtual Environment Generated by Anaconda

- [Anaconda Docs: *Creation of virtual environment*](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html)
- [Machine Learning: *Conda create environment and everything you need to know to manage conda virtual environment*](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/deployment/conda-create-environment-and-everything-you-need-to-know-to-manage-conda-virtual-environment/)

- it is a very convenient thing to use Anaconda to create a virtual environment. It creates a virtual environment for you outside of the project folder. And you can choose the version of Python you want to use.

#### 7.1.2.1. Create a virtual environment

```bash
conda create -n venv python=3.8
```

#### 7.1.2.2. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
conda activate venv
```

#### 7.1.2.3. Deactivate the virtual environment

```bash
conda deactivate
```

#### 7.3.2.4. Remove the virtual environment

```bash
conda remove --name venv --all
```

#### 7.3.2.5. List the virtual environment

```bash
conda env  list
```

or

```bash
conda info --envs
```

### 7.1.3. Working with `.env` File

- [Using .env Files for Environment Variables in Python Applications](https://dev.to/jakewitcher/using-env-files-for-environment-variables-in-python-applications-55a1)
 
- To create a `.env` file, you can use any text editor.
- You can use the `.env` file to store environmental variables.
- `.env` file should be stored in the project folder.

#### 7.1.3.1. Create a `.env` file

```bash
touch .env
```

#### 7.1.3.2. Syntax of `.env` file

```bash
# .env file
# VARIABLE_NAME="VALUE"
API_KEY=your_api_key
API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Other variables
EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

#### 7.1.3.3. Import the `.env` file

- In order to import the `.env` file in Python, you can use the `dotenv` module.

`dotenv` can be installed as follows:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

- in Python, you can use the `load_dotenv` function to load the `.env` file.

```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()
```




#### 7.1.3.4. Use the `.env` file in Python

- in order to read the variables from the `.env` file, you can use the `os` module.
- in Python, you can use the `os.getenv` function to read the variables from the `.env` file.

```python
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY")
API_SECRET = os.getenv("API_SECRET")
```

- if there is a possibility that the environmental variable isn't set, you can set the default when calling the `os.getenv` function.

```python
import os
API_KEY = os.getenv("API_KEY", "your_api_key")  # your_api_key is the default if the environmental variable is not set
API_SECRET = os.getenv("API_SECRET", "your_api_secret")  # your_api_secret is the default if the environmental variable is not set
```

## 7.2. `.gitignore` File

- [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore)
- [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io)

- In order to ignore files in the project folder, you can use the `.gitignore` file. The `.gitignore` file is a text file that contains a list of files and directories that you want to ignore when you commit your project to GitHub and in that way it protects the details you want to keep hidden from the public.
- Beware, the files in the `.gitignore` file are ignored by Git. Thier changes are not tracked, and if deleted, you cannot revert them.
- To create a `.gitignore` file, you can use any text editor and save it in the project folder.

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

#### 7.2.1. Syntax of `.gitignore` file

- The `.gitignore` file is a list of files and directories to be ignored. Every new item is added to the next line.

```bash
# .gitignore file
# Ignore all text files
*.txt
# Ignore a directory and its contents
venv/
# Ignore a specific file
.env
```

#### 7.2.2. Tools to automatically generate `.gitignore` file

- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)

  - When making a new repository, GitHub gives an option to automatically generate a `.gitignore` file according to the selected template. You can select `Python` from the dropdown list. 

- [Gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io)
  - Gitignore.io generates a `.gitignore` file according to the selected template. You can select `Python` or `Vanilla Python` from the dropdown list or type it into the text box.
  - You can then copy the generated contents from the web page and paste it into a new `.gitignore` file of your project.
